# SudoTweaksStorage

This stores all the different tweaks that the SudoTweaks extension runs.

Example of a config.json file:
`
{
  "name": "No Magenta Playbar",
  "description": "Removes magenta gradient on playbar on youtube.",
  "website": "https://www.youtube.com",
  "script": "script.js",
  "css": "styles.css"
}
`
SudoTweaks extension then grabs all the different tweaks and shows them in a menu where the user can select one and it will run on that website.
